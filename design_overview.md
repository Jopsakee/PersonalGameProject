# Main design philosophy
## Core Pillars
1. Looter-Shooter/ Hack-And-Slash
2. Dungeon Crawler
3. Top down and 2D
4. Style is a mix between sci-fi and medieval

## Similar games
Warframe: The gameplay loop would be similar to warframe the most. You're in your hub and can choose out of multiple "zones" to play on and it will generate a random tileset with an objective to complete. You kill enemies and complete the objective and afterwards you extract with your new found loot and return to your hub to gear up and get ready for your next mission

## Combat reference
Because the game is repetitive and focused on being a looter shooter it will need to have satisfying combat. It needs to be responsive and visceral(gore comes to mind). There has to be feedback when hitting enemies. There will both be ranged and melee combat. The game will also have a talent tree that players can spec into different archetypes with. Each archetype has a unique ability that they will be able to use in the missions. They will be determined as development continues.

## Equipment
### Primary weapon
This will be your primary weapon, the weapon that on average deals the most damage. This will always be a ranged weapon. 

### Secondary weapon
If you're out of ammo for your primary weapon then this weapon will be a back up weapon, usually less strong but will still do the trick.

### Melee weapon
A melee weapon that can be freely swapped to at any time. In case you're tired of shooting your enemies in the face.

### Armor
A combination of all types of armor slots, helmet+body+gloves+legs+boots that will all give defensive or offensive stats/ unique bonuses that will be determined later.

### Enemies
For now just a lot of random things to shoot. Will be determined

### Zones
A couple tilesets that randomly generate each time will be enough.
